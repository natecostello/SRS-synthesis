
damped_sine_syn.m is the main matlab script.  
It synthesizes an acceleration time history to satisfy a shock response spectrum specification.
The time history is a series of damped sine functions
The series is then represented as wavelets so that the net displacement and net velocity are each zero.
The remaining scripts are supporting functions.
Please contact me if you have any questions.
